                    <p>Setting up is simple with the Bitmovin Player. Thumbnails are loaded into the timeline as a
                        track. All you need to do is to tell the player the location of the thumbnail file:</p>

            <p>To set up your video player with thumbnails have a look at

            <h2>What’s required for a video player with thumbnails</h2>

            <p>
                Adaptive Streaming relies on encoding your video into several groups of files (streams) at various
                resolutions, while thumbnails also need to be generated in the encoding process. The encoder creates a
                set of thumbnail images and combines them into a single image file (“Sprite”). For more
                information on encoding your videos, have a look at our <a href="https://bitmovin.com/encoding/">Cloud
                Encoding Service</a>.
